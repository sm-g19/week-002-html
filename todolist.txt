Notes re what I want to do for to do list

Recreate index page from scratch by
- using mv command to change old file to draft_index.html
- use touch command to recreate index.html 
- setting up boilerplate in new index file
- set up head by 
--inserting title
--linking to css sheets and normalisation and google fonts

- set up body
-- header 1
Set up initial input part of page in html
- form for input
- fieldset in form - not sure why I'm using this, I've forgotten
- legend for instructions
- input types: text for task, date for due date
- create submit button - can I get the text on the button to read "Add to list"?

Then create a list of the to do items (initially this was in a table but then we learnt about responsive design so converted to a list so that I could think about containers.
Set up list for completed tasks too
- these will have similar structures but will be pulling in data from different places

Adding in Bootstrap to index.html so can use responsive design into <head> before other style sheets, info herehttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/
N.B. adding the Bootstrap link has removed the box line around my input area
Components
- updating my buttons
-- submit button
-- done/update choice so radio

Containers
"Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Choose from a responsive, fixed-width container (meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint) or fluid-width (meaning itâ€™s 100% wide all the time)." https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/#containers
so that means that the input box could be fluid to keep it along the top always - N.B. may need to change to responsive as design moves on otherwise input fields will be tiny in some cases




CSS sheet
1. set background colours and font
2. create heading class
3. create style elements for label, legend, paragraph
4. putting the font style in the body attributes means that all text picks up that style and then I modify for each heading and other items 
5. set up a button class - use "danger" button as it's red


I need a delete button which uses a function. My button will be called remove as the content to be removed will be sent to a DONE page with that day's date
will also need an UPDATE button which will return task to the input form to have the date updated

convert table code to containers

set class values for the inputs - do these need to be changed to outputs, which then get sent to a container called "To Do List"
